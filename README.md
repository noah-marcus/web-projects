## Overview

At Lehigh University, I took two Web Design classes
that were offered by our design school, not through
our typical engineering. I found the classes 
challenging & rewarding, for we approached these
websites through a more creative lens. This is only
a selection of what I built. 

I have also included my 'Mockups' fodler under each 
project for a glimps into my creative process :)

Interactive Story
-----------------
The assignment was to build an interactive story, 
a la the famous NYTimes interactive articles. With 
an interest in humor, I took one of my favorite 
Onion articles and attempted to ~enhance~ the humor
with some interactive webdesign. 

CSS Zen Garden
--------------
A classic challenge for web design. Given a static 
html page, the designers must create a unique webpage
by only changing the CSS file. I attempted to make 
my Zen Garden look like my desktop, with the webpage 
appearing through a terminal.

Lehigh Pizza
------------
My assignment was to take a local business and spruce up
their website. I chose my favorite pizza shop, where I 
had my first meal off campus! My aim was to create a website
that looked like it used a template, but to do it all from 
scratch. I made it grow and shrink to phone, tablet, and 
computer size with tedious css, all in the name of ~learning~.

## How to Run
For simplicity, clone this repo, navigate to the folder, and
open the index.html file with your browser of choice. 
Unfortunatley, the website I used to host these has since 
expired.
